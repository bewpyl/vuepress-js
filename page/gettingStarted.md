# Getting Started

## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language designed to interact with the elements of web pages. JavaScript consists of three main parts:

- ECMAScript that provides the core functionality.
- The Document Object Model (DOM), which provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
- The Browser Object Model (BOM), which provides interfaces for interacting with the web browsers.

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page. You usually use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality of a web page such as creating interactive maps, displaying animated charts.

When a web page is loaded i.e. after HTML and CSS have been downloaded, the web browser’s JavaScript engine starts executing the JavaScript code. The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically using DOM interfaces.

### Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript

When JavaScript is used in a web page, it is executed in the web browsers of user’s computers, therefore, we called JavaScript is client-side language.

JavaScript can run on both the web browsers as well as on the servers. A popular server-side environment for JavaScript is Node.js. Different from the client-side JavaScript, the server-side JavaScript executes on the server and its result is displayed on the web browsers.
